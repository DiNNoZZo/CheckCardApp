Bug: at the first start of the application, the application starts incorrectly for some reason and does not respond. It can be caused by the version of next or the app route approach.

The application just needs to be reloaded and it works as it should

The error only occurs on the development server. When the application is built, everything works fine

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
